N16961.This is an epidemic serogroup of Vibrio cholerae isolated in 1971 in Bangladesh and is distinguished from the classical biotype due to hemolysin production. It contains 2 chromosomes. The first, and larger chromosome, contains many essential cell functions, as well as virulence genes contained within pathogenicity islands (PAIs). One major pathogenicity determinant is encoded within a PAI that is contained inside an integrated phage (CTXphi) on chromosome 1 that codes for the cholera toxin, an adenylate cyclase. Once the toxin is injected into host cells, it results in secretion of chlorine ions, which leads to increased water secretion, dehydration, and eventually, death. Up to 20 litres of water a day may be lost. The second chromosome also has important cell functions, but has a preponderance of genes associated with energy and transport functions, including signal transduction systems, and in addition, DNA repair enzymes. Chromosome 2 also has the integron island, a large variable region of the chromosome that functions as a gene capture system, some of which are associated with antibiotic resistance. There are 105 genes that have copies on both chromosomes.

This plant pathogen affects rice plants by causing leaf blight, a major problem in Asian countries where rice production occurs on an industrial scale. Losses of up to 50% of the total crop can occur in extreme cases. This pathogen enters the xylem and spreads throughout the vascular tissue of the plant, which results in wilting of the plant, or to leaf blight if the infection occurs later in development. This organism shares common virulence determinants with Xanthomonas campestris including an hrp (hypersensitive response) system that is a type III secretion system for delivery of effector molecules to the host cell cytoplasm, and avr (avirulence) genes. Other pathogenicity determinants include extracellular polysaccharide, adhesins, a type II secretion system and the extracellular enzymes secreted by it, as well as some toxins.

This organism is a slowly growing species, with doubling times of around 22-24 hours. One of the important diagnostic features of this bacterium is that its growth in laboratory settings depends on the presence of mycobactin J, a natural siderophore. This bacterium is not common in the environment, and is predominantly found as an intracellular parasite. It causes a chronic granulomatous enteritis termed Johne's disease or paratuberculosis. The desease affects domestic and free-ranging ruminants, but has also been reported in primates, rabbits, stoats and foxes. The usually fatal disease is characterized by weight loss and diarrhea, after a long pre-clinical phase. Treatment is ineffective and economically impracticable. Paratuberculosis in domestic livestock entails significant economic losses in the dairy industry totaling $1.5 billion annually. Several reports suggest a role for this organism in the etiology of Crohn's disease, a severe inflammatory bowel disease in humans. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis strain K-10. This strain was isolated from a dairy herd in Wisconsin in the 1970's by investigators from the USDA National Animal Disease Center. It is an extensively studied low passage clinical strain and is amenable to genetic manipulation.

CBDB1. This strain was isolated from an enriched chlorobenzene-dechlorinatng mixed culture from anoxic river sediment. It is capable of reductive dechlorination, replacing chlorine with hydrogen, of environmental pollutants such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDDs and PCDFs), by utilizing them as electron acceptors during anaerobic respiration. Genome analysis suggests this organism has 32 reductive-dehalogenase-homologous loci, arranged as two genes, rdhA and rdhB. RdhA is thought to be the active subunit while the hydrophobic protein RhdB is presumably a membrane-anchor for RdhA. The rdh loci are typically found in the origin-proximal portion of the chromosome, and are usually transcribed in the direction of DNA replication, suggesting that they are highly expressed. These genes are also associated with genes encoding two-component and other types of regulatory systems, suggesting that these loci are under regulatory control based on environmental stimuli.
